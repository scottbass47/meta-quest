Collision System
-----------------
- Split between filters, behaviors and the exception table
- All physics bodies have known fixture types
- Filters and behaviors are tied to fixtures (using fixture types), which then make up the entity's physics body

Filters
--------
- Collision Type (i.e. projectile, mob, tile, sensor)
- Entity Type (i.e. friendly, neutral, enemy)
- Custom (implement method that filters collisions based defined conditionals)
- 

Behaviors
--------
- Used to define what should happen upon collision
- Multiple behaviors can be associated with a filter
- Behaviors should be modular and reusable

Possible Behaviors
------------------
- Damage on contact -> when collision occurs, damage is applied to colliding entity (ignored if colliding entity can't receive damage)
- Continuous damage on contact -> same as damage on contact, but damage is continually applied (define interval)
- Death on contact -> entity death occurs when colliding

Exception Table
---------------
- A 2D table of defined exceptions
- Exceptions are declared by FixtureType

Features
--------
- Default registration of filters and behaviors (lookup table for default collision behavior based on fixture type)
- Multiple behaviors defined per filter, and multiple filters can be defined per fixture type
- Exception table used for exceptions to general rules (always overrides general rule)

Process
-------
1. Collision occurs between two fixtures
2. Fixture type, collision data, and entity are extracted from fixtures
3. Fixtures are looked up in exception table to see if there is an entry (if there is, the collision is processed and no more processing is required)
4. Loop through list of filters to see if colliding fixture passes through the filters
5. If the fixture passes the filter test, loop through the list of behaviors associated with the filter and run those

Questions
---------
- What methods should be used for handling collisions (begin, pre-solve, post-solve, end)?
- How are behaviors defined?
- How to handle multiple fixtures per entity problem (i.e. damage on contact been called once for each fixture, not once for each entity)?

Code Changes
------------
- Damage needs to be in one place
